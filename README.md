### Objective Mapper
================

Guiding questions:
- How well do exam questions map onto lecture objectives?
- Do faculty and students map objectives differently, either qualitatively (i.e. use a different objective to map) or quantitatively (i.e. using a measure of strength association)?
- Are their objectives that aren't being used? Or objectives that are over-represented?
